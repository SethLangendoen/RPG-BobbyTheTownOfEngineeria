In the town of Enginerea, where people are destined to become master builders, there lived a man named Bobby the Builder. From an early age, Bobby had a passion for building and designing. He spent countless years perfecting his craft and becoming the Supreme Builder of the town. 
One day, a terrible earthquake struck Enginerea resulting in severe damage to many of the town buildings including the Town hall. It is the job of the Supreme Builder to rebuild the town hall to its former glory. However, in his endeavor to rebuild the town hall, he must face-off against countless other master builders who want to take the title of the Supreme Builder.
